# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This project uses Home Assistant's calendar versioning scheme (`YYYY.M.P`, for example `2026.10.0`).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

## [2026.10.4] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- **Dynamic Transport Mode Icons for Map and Dashboard Entities**:
  - Live vehicle tracker (`device_tracker.<entry>_vehicle_tracker`) now renders transport-specific Material Design icons dynamically on the Home Assistant Map area and Map cards based on the active vehicle mode:
    - Train: `mdi:train`
    - Bus: `mdi:bus`
    - Ferry: `mdi:ferry`
    - Tram / Light Rail: `mdi:tram`
    - Fallback: `mdi:bus-marker`
  - Next Service sensor (`sensor.<entry>_next_service`) also dynamically adjusts its entity icon to match the mode of transport for the upcoming journey or departure.
- **Enhanced GTFS-Realtime Trip & Vehicle Correlation**:
  - Fixed cross-feed correlation between Journey Planner itinerary legs (which format trip identifiers as `s_T_<service>_<dir>_<date>_<trip_id>`) and GTFS-RT `VehiclePositions` and `TripUpdates` feeds (which format trip identifiers as `<trip_id>-<agency>...`).
  - Extracted and indexed normalized base trip IDs across feeds, allowing real-time GPS locations, speed, bearing, and live arrival delays to accurately track trains, buses, ferries, and trams in real time on the Map.

### Changed
- **Home Assistant 2026.10 Compatibility & Standards**:
  - Modernized platform setup entry signatures across all entity platforms (`device_tracker`, `sensor`, `event`, and `diagnostics`) with `TranslinkConfigEntry` type annotations.
  - Aligned `TrackerEntity` location accuracy reporting to use `float` values (`15.0`) in accordance with the latest Home Assistant core specifications.
  - Added `route_color` attribute to `device_tracker` extra state attributes to support custom card rendering and map track styling.

## [2026.10.3] - 2026-10-06

### Changed
- **Brand Logos and Icons**:
  - Updated integration brand icons and logos (`icon.png`, `icon@2x.png`, `logo.png`, `logo@2x.png`) to the official Translink 3-blade swirl emblem with high-resolution transparency.

## [2026.10.2] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed
- **Platform Sensor Icon**:
  - Replaced invalid non-existent icon string `mdi:train-car-platform` with valid Home Assistant core standard icon `mdi:bus-stop-uncovered`.
  - Added explicit `icon="mdi:bus-stop-uncovered"` attribute to `platform` entity descriptions in both Journey and Stop departure sensors.

## [2026.10.1] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- **Disruption Event Entity (`event.<entry>_disruption`)**:
  - Implements Home Assistant's native `event` entity platform (`EventEntity`) for service disruption alerts.
  - Fires `disruption` events containing full incident attributes (`title`, `description`, `cause`, `effect`, `severity`, `route`, and notice list) whenever disruptions are detected or updated.
  - Fires `cleared` events when service returns to normal, enabling instant automation triggers and smartphone push notifications.
- **Disruption Description Sensor (`sensor.<entry>_disruption_description`)**:
  - Diagnostic text sensor displaying the active disruption headline (or `Normal` when clear) directly on dashboards and glance cards.
  - Includes multi-line formatted summary and details in entity extra state attributes.
- **Enriched Disruption Sensor Attributes**:
  - `sensor.<entry>_disruptions` now provides `summary`, `description`, `latest_title`, `latest_description`, and structured disruption notice lists in addition to notice counts.
- **Comprehensive Notice Mapping**:
  - Added notice extraction and cross-referencing between itinerary legs and Translink notice feeds in `TranslinkApiClient`.

## [2026.10.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- **Initial release of Translink Queensland integration for Home Assistant (HACS)**.
- **Journey Planner Tracking**:
  - Real-time journey planning between any Origin and Destination in South East Queensland and regional networks.
  - Sensors for Next Departure timestamp, Arrival timestamp, Total Duration, Status, Transfers count, Next Route / Service, Origin Platform, Adult Go Card Fare (50c fares), Walking Distance, and Disruption Alerts count.
  - Rich journey attributes including full leg breakdown, intermediate/skipped stops, operator info, route hex color codes, and encoded polyline for map cards.
- **Live Vehicle GPS Tracking**:
  - `device_tracker` entity providing live vehicle location (latitude, longitude), bearing, speed, and vehicle ID from Translink's GTFS Realtime feeds.
- **Stop & Station Departure Boards**:
  - Dedicated Stop mode for tracking upcoming departures, platforms, and line delays for any Translink bus stop, train station, ferry terminal, or tram station.
- **Location Autocomplete & Geolocation Support**:
  - Dynamic station/stop search via Translink's search API in config and options flows.
- **Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale (Platinum)**:
  - Strict type checking, Pydantic v2 data models, async I/O with injected websession.
  - Complete translations (`strings.json`, `translations/en.json`) and icon definitions (`icons.json`).
  - Redacted diagnostics download support.
  - Robust test suite with comprehensive unit and integration tests.
