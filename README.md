[![Quality Scale: Platinum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant%20Quality%20Scale-Platinum-blue.svg)](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/)

The **Translink Queensland** custom integration connects Home Assistant directly to the [Translink](https://translink.com.au/) public transport network across South East Queensland (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Ipswich, Logan, Moreton Bay, Redlands) and regional Queensland centers.

It brings the complete real-time experience of the official Translink app into Home Assistant:
- **Journey Planning & Commute Tracking**: Real-time departure times, arrival times, duration, transfer counts, origin/destination platforms, line colors, Queensland 50c fares, and walking directions between any Starting Point and Destination.
- **Live Vehicle GPS Tracking**: Real-time `device_tracker` entity powered by Translink's open GTFS-RT feeds, exposing live vehicle coordinates, bearing, and speed directly on Home Assistant maps.
- **Station & Stop Departure Boards**: Real-time upcoming service timetables and platform allocations for any bus stop, train station, ferry terminal, or tram station.
- **Disruptions & Service Alerts**: Live network disruption alerts and delay tracking.

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

- **Public Open Data Feeds**: Translink journey planning and GTFS-Realtime feeds are open and do not require user credentials or API keys.
- **Vehicle Live Tracking Availability**: Vehicles appear on the live map when active in service and transmitting GTFS-RT coordinates. If a vehicle has not yet begun its scheduled run, the entity remains available with the platform's station coordinates until live tracking commences.
- **Diagnostics**: You can download an anonymized diagnostics bundle from **Settings > Devices & Services > Translink > Download Diagnostics** to assist with bug reports.

## Removing the Integration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** and locate **Translink**.
2. Click the three-dot menu on the entry and select **Delete**.
3. If installed via HACS, open **HACS > Integrations > Translink > Remove** and restart Home Assistant.
